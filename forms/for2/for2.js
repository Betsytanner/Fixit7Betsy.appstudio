/*
#1 Scenario: You will be writing a program using a while loop that runs as many times as the user wants it to run. At each cycle, it will output a message. 
Requirements
Rename the first form 'while'.
Each time the loop runs, it must output a line of text that shows the value of i at that iteration of the loop.
The output must be to the console, in this format: 

     This is loop iteration 1.
     This is loop iteration 2.
     etc.         
When the loop is done, it must output: 
     The loop is now done. 
    */ 

//IDK!!! COME BACK TOO - problem is not printing out - and is not breaking 
i = 0;
let imptnumb = prompt("How many times would you like the loop to run?"); 
while (imptnumb <= i) {
console.log(alert(`This is loop iteration + ${imptnumb}`));
  i ++;
  break
  console.log(alert(`The loop is now done`));
  }
